'Vāmana' (Sanskrit वामन) means 'dwarf', 'small' or 'small or short in stature'. It also means 'dwarfish bull',[1] which is notable as Vishnu is directly associated with dwarfish animals (including bulls) in the Vedas (see below). Stated in Puranic literature to be born of the great sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, other names or epithets referring to Vamana include:

Name	Sanskrit	Meaning / Description
'Balibandhana' or 'Balibandhanakrt'	बलिबन्धन	'binder or killer of Bali';[7] stated in the Garuda Purana to mean 'who fettered the demon Bali' (see below).
'Dadhi-vamana'	दधिवामन	'bestowing', 'giving', 'curd' / 'curdled milk' (regarded as a remedy),[12] and 'resin of Shala tree' (apparently sacred and favoured by Vishnu; used for incense, in Ayurvedic medicine, to build dwellings, and to caulk boats).[13]
'Trivikrama'	त्रिविक्रम	'three steps' or 'three strides' (tri 'three' + vikrama 'step' or 'stride').[2][14] This epithet refers to the three steps or strides of Vishnu in the Rigveda.
'Urukrama'	उरुक्रम	'far stepping' or 'wide stride', presumably in relation to covering all existence with the second step (e.g. Skanda Purana 1.19.42).[3]
'Upendra'	उपेन्द्र	'younger brother of Indra' or simply 'a son'.[4][5] This epithet refers to the birth of the Dwarf Avatar as one of the 12 adityas - sons - of Aditi and the sage Kashyapa (i.e. along with Indra).
'Vāmanadeva'	वामनदेव	'dwarf-god' (vamana 'dwarf' + deva 'god').
