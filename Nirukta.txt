Written by the grammarian Yaska, Nirukta is one of the six Vedangas or 'limbs of the Vedas', concerned with correct etymology and interpretation of the Vedas. The entry for Vishnu (relating to the Rigveda) states (square brackets '[ ]' are as per the original author):

Vishnu strode over this (Universe). Thrice he planted his foot, enveloped in dust.

Vishnu strides over this and all that exists. Thrice he plants his foot, [for threefold existence].'On earth, in the intermediate space, and in heaven, says Sakapuni. 'On the mountain of sunrise, on the meridian, and on the mountain of sunset' says Aurnavabha.

Enveloped in his [dust], i. e. the footprint is not visible in the stormy atmosphere. Or it is used in a metaphorical sense, i.e. his footstep is not visible, as if enveloped in a dusty place. Pdmsavah (Dust) is (so called) because it is produced (√su) by feet (pddaih) or else it lies scattered on the ground, or it is trodden down.

— The Nighantu and the Nirukta, translated by Lakshman Sarup (1967), Chapter 12, Section 19[22]
This account essentially states that the three footsteps may symbolise the positions of the sun or physical existence conceptualised as 'three worlds'. In regard to the references to Sakapuni and Aurnavabha, K. S. Murty states that 'Yaska was not the first to interpret Vedic words as he did. He referred to a Nighantu with Samamnaya which he cited and explained. He had predecessors like Sakapuru, Audumbarayana, Aupamanyava and others'.
